## Firestore Security Rules

The following rules must be added to Firebase Firestore to enable the Assets Manager:

```javascript
// Allow admin users to manage brand assets
match /brandAssets/{document} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.token.email in [
      'jrocchetti@paradigmproductionsgroup.com',
      'admin@test.com'
    ];
}
```

## Firebase Storage Rules

Recommended Firebase Storage security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /brand-assets/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.token.email in [
          'jrocchetti@paradigmproductionsgroup.com',
          'admin@test.com'
        ];
    }
  }
}
```
