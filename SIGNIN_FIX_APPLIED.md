# âœ… Sign-In Fix Applied

## Problem Fixed
The "Sign In" button on the assets page was redirecting to `login.html`, which then redirected to `index.html` after successful authentication, taking users away from the assets page.

## Solution Applied
1. **Changed the Sign In button** to handle authentication directly on the assets page
2. **Added `handleSignIn()` function** that uses Google OAuth without redirecting
3. **Removed the redirect to login.html** - everything happens on the assets page

## What Changed
- `assets.html` line 559: Changed `href="login.html"` to `href="#" onclick="handleSignIn(event)"`
- Added new `handleSignIn()` function that:
  - Shows Google sign-in popup
  - Validates Paradigm email domain
  - Updates UI automatically via Firebase auth state change
  - Stays on the assets page (no redirects)

## How To Test
1. **Open `assets.html` in your browser**
2. **Click "Sign In"** in the top navigation
3. **Sign in with your Paradigm Google account**
4. **Verify you stay on the assets page** after successful sign-in
5. **Check that admin features appear** (upload sections, admin panel)

## Expected Behavior
- âœ… Click "Sign In" â†’ Google popup appears
- âœ… Sign in with `jrocchetti@paradigmproductionsgroup.com`
- âœ… Popup closes, welcome message appears
- âœ… You remain on the assets page
- âœ… Admin features become visible
- âœ… Upload sections and manage assets functionality available

## No More Redirects! ðŸŽ‰
The authentication now happens seamlessly on the assets page without any unwanted redirects to index.html.
